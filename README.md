# DIMMpy
A python library to simulate an analyse data from a Differential Image Motion Monitor (DIMM).

This package contains tools to reduce the size of data being recorded by the camera and also allows for analysis on DIMMs using fixed telescopes, where the image may lie anywhere on the sensor. This method is designed to ignore cosmic ray events.
